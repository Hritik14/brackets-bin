# ATTENTION
This repository only exists because of the [libcef issue](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/14485).
It tries to replace the `libcef.so` of the latest brackets release by the one found in version 1.12, as mentioned [in this comment](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/14485#issuecomment-489289266)
